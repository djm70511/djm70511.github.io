    The dawgs may have lost the game, but really showed why we hunker down at all times.
    Here is a link to the game statistics from the biggest rivalry in Jacksonville, Florida.

    <p>It was a lot of fun down in Jacksonville, although the Gators came out on top. The bulldogs did however, win the party,and the gator wore more pairs of jean shorts (which we count as a win). Here are some more stats that will remind us of one of the most heated rivalries in college football, the 2016 edition of the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party!</p>

  On their Fall Break many students from the University of Georgia traveled down Georgia 
  Highway 15 all the way to St. Simons Island, GA to attend what is today known as 
  "Frat Beach." This is a tradition unmatched by the Gators and a reason that the finest 
  University in the Southeast will forever win the partying portion of the Georgia-Florida game. 
  After countless "Callings of the Dawgs," and plenty of fun in St. Simon's the UGA 
  students headed even further south to Jacksonville, FL. Although the game was lost, we 
  once again showed our pride for the greatest university in all of the land, fighting it out through the 
  last whistle. The bulldog nation is a proud one, and smelly, jort-wearing Gators can't 
  take that away from us!!!
